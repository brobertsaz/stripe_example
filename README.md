# Monospace

Monospace is a social network for developers. It's our sample Rails
application, showing how to use Stripe to charge subscribers.

Monospace uses the Stripe Javascript bindings to validate a credit card, and
the Stripe Ruby bindings to create a customer and add the credit card to that
customer. Customers can also update their credit card.

You can play with a live version at https://monospace-rails.herokuapp.com/
